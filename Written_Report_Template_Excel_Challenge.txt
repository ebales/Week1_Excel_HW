# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview and Purpose
	This project used data collected from the Kickstarter platform to better understand the trends associated with a successful funding campaign.
	The purpose of this analysis was to gain insight to guide Louisa as she prepared to crowdfund an upcoming production.
	Two questions we're looking to answer are when Louisa should launch her campaign, and how much she should look to source.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	Based on the launch date analysis, funding campaigns for theater programs launched in early Summer are the most likely to succeed.
	There isn't a strong correlation between a launch date and failed or canceled campaigns, but the holiday season appears to be a more challenging time to launch.
		

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Funding campaigns for plays are most successful with goals of $5,000 and less with 73% of plays being fully funded by the end of the campaign.
	Campaigns with a goal of $10,000 are still more likely to succeed than fail, but historically 55% have succeeded.
	Though the data shows 67% of plays with a goal between $35,000 and $40,000 are successful, there were only 4 programs total in that range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	One challenge was ensuring all values were accounted for in the COUNTIFS functions.  Thought my data sheet was filtered, I was still pulling from the full data set in my functions.
	With a dataset so large, it can be difficult to get a "gut check" on if the values being pulled through the functions are correct.
	It can be a challenge to understand the story behind some of the data- are some campaign owners more well known? Or do they have repeat backers that always donate?

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. Programs launched in early Summer have the greatest likelyhood of being successful, and campaigns launched in Oct, Nov, and Dec have the least likelyhood of being succesful.
	2. May and June are the most popular months to launch funding campaigns for theater projects.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	1. Campaigns with smaller goals are the most successful and the majority of campaigns have a goal of $5000 or less.
	2. As campaign goals rise, the likelyhood of success drops.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	This data set does not provide information on individual pledges.  We can get an average donation, but we aren't able to decifer if one large donation made funding successful.
	

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	We could look at duration of campaign to understand how long successful and failed campaigns run. 
	We could evaluate the correlation between "spotlight" campaigns and the level of success or failure.
